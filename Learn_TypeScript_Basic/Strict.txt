1. Strict flag & strict type-checking options:
- In tsconfig.json, there is a group of strict type-checking options.

- "strict" option:
    + Values:
        true:
            Enable all strict type-checking options, which are outlined below the "strict" option.

- "noImplicitAny" option:
    + In some cases where no type annotations are present,
    TypeScript will fall back to a type of 'any' for a variable when it cannot infer the type.
    + Values:
        true:
            Enable error reporting when the problem above occurs.

- "strictNullChecks" option:
    + Values:
        true:
            'null' and 'undefined' have their own distinct types
            and you'll get a type error if you try to use them where a concrete value is expected.
        false:
            null and undefined are effectively ignored by the language.
            This can lead to unexpected errors at runtime.

- "alwaysStrict" option:
    + Ensures that your files are parsed in the ECMAScript strict mode,
    and emit 'use strict' for each source file.
    + Values:
        true:
            Enable strict mode.
